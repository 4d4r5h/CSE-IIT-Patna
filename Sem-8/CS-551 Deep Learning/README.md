It's a good course to get the basic understanding of Deep learning and maths involved in it. You might not learn much if you already know DL, it might be a refresher for you. More beneficial for absolute beginners. 
Do note that classes are absolute DRAG if Arijit sir takes them up. No brainer if Joydeep sir is the instructor.
