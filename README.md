# CSE-IIT-Patna

Greetings people from the Future! <br>
Since you are here, I'm going to assume that you are a part of the rich fraternity of IIT Patna. I'm also going to assume that you are soon going to have the gruelling Semester examinations, or you simply have an assignment that's due, Or anything in between really.

We've all been there, and in our case many many years before you guys. And we've probably already figured out our way around the Tricky tutorials, Ambiguous assignments and the Exhilarating exams, and there's no need for you guys to go through the same suffering. So, we decided to build this repo that includes all the course content related to all the courses on offer for Computer Science Students.

# Guide to use
Repo contains 8 Sub-Repos corresponding to 8 semesters. Each Semester repo has Folders corresponding to the subjects in the format **\<Course Name\> - \<Course Code\>**
And each Subject folder contains content split in to the following parts.
 - Slides
 - Notes
 - Assignments / Tutorials
 - Mid-Sem
 - End-Sem
