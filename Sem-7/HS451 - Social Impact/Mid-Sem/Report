Qn.1: In YOUR words summarise the problem, the approach and the solution discussed in the case study. (max 100 words) - 10 ma

Demand for inclusion of citizens in the governments administrative decision process has been on rise in European Union. Cueing institutions to consider innovative approaches for inclusive&sustainable urban planning framework using ICTs(best way to promote inter-community interactions). Miramap by Politecnico di Torino, is a governing tool which offers a platform to effectively integrate the population’s perspectives on public services. It is based on a social-networking, web-based mapping system, with transparent and easy-to-use interface; to send information, discuss local infrastructure problems etc. but also to report proposals and positive aspects of their neighborhood. This provides people&policymakers comprehensive view of problems and opportunities in neighborhood. 


Qn.2: If you were to apply HCD principles in approaching the problem: (a) which STAKEHOLDERS would you have identified, and for each stakeholder (b) how would you have planned a needs discovery (Hear) session. (max 100 words) - 20 marks *

•	Citizens->Group&Individual Interview->To understand current behaviour&reasoning involved in users&administration interactions and pain-points involved at individual and community level.
•	Researchers->Expert Interview->To validate current hypothesis of current user&community level problems.
•	Public Administrators ->Expert Interview->To understand the pain points involved in current administrative architectures and potential problems in new architecture adoptions.
•	Policy Makers->Expert Interview&In-Context immersion->To understand the nuances and key considerations involving in drafting new policies and also to understand how populace sentiment affects policy making.
•	Social Network Influencers->Expert Interview&Self-Documentation->To empathize with community representatives and understand how to properly channel perspectives of complex, dynamic community and manage multifaceted populace 


Qn.3: Of the stakeholders you have identified in response to qn.2, suppose you had the opportunity to interview ONE of the stakeholders face to face. Draft at least FOUR questions that you would ask them. Also, for each question you are proposing briefly describe what you are hoping to achieve/understand by asking that question. (Max 100 words) - 10 marks *

Administrators&Policy makers:
1)	What factors go into the political agendas. And how do they affect policy-making process?
a.	Understanding the key considerations of government in policy-making. Eg: Public outcry, International Relations etc.
2)	How do you validate the factors?

3)	How does the populace usually respond to new policies, and how is feedback monitored?
a.	Understanding the most common response/feedback from citizens and its source.
4)	How does the administration respond to public sentiment?
a.	Understanding the effect of feedback on policies and identifying painpoints in whole feedback process.
5)	Where there previously any trials to adopt new feedback systems or collaborative architectures?
a.	Understanding bars to clear for new architecture implementation.


Qn.4: Based on your research about the case study of your choice could you comment on other markets/geographies where similar problems exist and the key learnings could benefit. Please include the URL/references to augment your opinion. (Max 100 words. References don't count towards word limit.) - 10 marks *

The demand for people’s involvement in public policy making process and dealing with their own urban context is widely existent in the European Union. Similar solutions have been implemented in UK (Fix my street), IRIS Beta (Italy), Improve my City, Polly&Bob (Germany) etc. This shows an existence of market for such a solution. Therefore, I would implement the solution in prominent European cities like London, Paris, Rome, Zurich etc.
Additionally, after validating the solution in Developed countries, we could expand to developing countries after adjusting to the demographics and administrative constraints.
