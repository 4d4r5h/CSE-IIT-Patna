Stakeholder Identification:
----------------------------

For example, Teaching methods:
a) Students.
b) Teachers.
c) Administration.
d) Parents.
e) Education Ministry.
f) Technology Platforms.

To do: Duplicate Slide. Shrink problem box. List down stakeholders.
Can you communicate with stakeholders in current scenario.
What motivates you.
a) Addition to existing slides.
b) Each of the problems, make a stakeholder page.
c) Make a decision based on metrics (RICE score, Economic / Social Impact value, Ease-Experience-2Bill dollar problems)
d) Make questions for stakeholders.

Talking to stakeholders, gives more insights to the problem at hand.
Interview is as good as questions asked.
a) Questionaire. - Be clear regarding the cohort. No more than 9 questions.
    Cant be all subjective. Can be a conditional flow. Closed ended questions are screening questions.
b) Interviews. - Good interview is where we dont speak more than 10%.
c) Focus Groups. - Get a few ppl in a room and ask open ended questions. Do proper moderation (Enable everyone to speak)

Get consent.
