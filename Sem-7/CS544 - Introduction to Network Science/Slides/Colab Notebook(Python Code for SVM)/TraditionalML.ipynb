It can easily handle multiple continuous and categorical variables. SVM constructs a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate different classes. SVM generates an optimal hyperplane in an iterative manner, which is used to minimize an error.  The core idea of SVM is to find a maximum marginal hyperplane(MMH) that best divides the dataset into classes.\n",

Here, the kernel takes a low-dimensional input space and transforms it into a higher dimensional space. In other words, you can say that it converts nonseparable problem to separable problems by adding more dimensions to it. It is most useful in non-linear separation problem. Kernel trick helps you to build a more accurate classifier.\n",
