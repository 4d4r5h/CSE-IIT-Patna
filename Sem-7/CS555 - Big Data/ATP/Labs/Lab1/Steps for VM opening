1) Connect to IIT Patna's intranet using VPN

2) Open a command prompt

3) Type:

ssh iitp@Your_assigned_VM_IP_Address

# I am using - 172.16.27.166

Press Enter, and then type your password: iitp@123

The username and password is common for all the I/P Addresses i.e. username/password :- iitp/iitp@123

4) Check if the folder "wordcount" is already present in your home directory of assigned VM
If YES:
	then, rename the file by typing: $ mv wordcount wordcount-100

NOTE: Do not reboot the VM, else the IP address will change.
